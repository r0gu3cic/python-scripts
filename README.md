# Useful python scripts

This is a collection of scripts that I used for some tasks.  
All of them just make an API request for a certain service and perform simple tasks.
Scripts for GitHub have *gh_* at the start of a script name
Scripts for DigitalOcean have *gh_* at the start of a script name

## Usage

Run the script that you like/need, make sure to check the variables first before running :smiley:
